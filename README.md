# Penguin Species Classification
Author: Nada Topalović

This project was created as a student machine learning project and demonstrates the basic steps of building a classification model.

The project includes:
- Basic data exploration (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Model training using pipelines
- Model evaluation with cross-validation

The focus of the project was on writing a clean code, avoiding data leakage and understanding the full workflow.
## What i learned?
- How to organize a machine learning project  from data to evaluation
- Why are pipelines so important ofr preventing data leakage
- To train models using different parts of data to avoid overfitting
## Files
- `pingvini_konacni.py`: main Python script
- `data/penguins.csv`: dataset

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure `penguins.csv` is in the `data` folder
3. Run the script:
```bash
python penguins_classification.py
